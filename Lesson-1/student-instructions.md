## Setting up your Raspberry Pi using Google Coder

The Raspberry Pi is a bare bones computer. Itâ€™s not much use on its own. In order to use it as a webserver and create websites on it, we need to connect a number of things to it:

- An SD card. This card contains the Google Coder that can be loaded onto the Raspberry Pi in order for it to be used to create websites. You need to slide the card into the slot with the metal pins facing in towards the Raspberry Pi. The label should be visible when it is inserted.
- An Ethernet cable or WiFi adaptor. This will allow you to connect the Raspberry Pi to a local network to host your website projects on.
- A power adaptor. Plug the power adaptor into a socket and then the small USB connector into the Raspberry Pi. When you turn the socket switch on, you should see the Raspberry Pi flash and text should appear on the monitor.

**Note: A monitor, keyboard and mouse are not necessary, as you will connect to the Raspberry Pi from an internet browser on a different computer on the network.**

## Connect to your Raspberry Pi Coder Server

Now you have connected your Raspberry Pi to the local network you can use a computer or laptop to connect to it. You will see that after you plugged in the power cable some lights came on; this indicates that your Raspberry Pi Coder server is booting up. 

1. Give it a few minutes to boot, and then in the web browser on your computer type:

  ```
  http://coder.local/
  ```
  Don't forget the `http://` part!

2. You might have to enter the Coder number given to you by your teacher instead, for example `http://coder01.local/` or `http://coder02.local/`. 

3. Once connected, you will see a screen asking you to set up a password to protect your server. Set a password with your partner. **Note: You will need to make sure that you remember your password every lesson, or your work will be lost. You could use the RPi default password `raspberry`.**

## Hello Coder

Once connected to your Coder webserver you can create a new Coder app. On the main Coder page you will see a grid of boxes with names on them. These are projects (also called apps), and there are a few that come pre-installed on Coder. Some of them are simple, like Hello Coder. 

1. Click on the **hello coder** app.

2. Now click on the **edit** button at the top to see the HTML code that makes this webpage.

3. Change the test to say something different to hello world!

4. Save your changes.
