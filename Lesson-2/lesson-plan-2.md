# Lesson 2: What is HTML?

##Introduction

In this lesson we will be given an opportunity to program a new webpage using HTML; from creating a webpage on Google Coder, to careful syntax placement, to the joy of creating a simple webpage. In particular, we will learn how to use the HTML tags for headings, line breaks, and paragraphs.

## Learning objectives

- Know that websites are made up of a type of computer code called "HTML"
- Identify some HTML tags and what they are used for
- Be able to use HTML tags to create a basic webpage for a recipe

## Learning outcomes

###All students are able to:

- Know that websites are made up of HTML tags
- Create a new webpage on a Google Coder webserver
- Display some text in headings and main body text

###Most students are able to:

- Identify some HTML tags and explain their use
- Display text in multiple ways using HTML tags such as `<br>` and `<h2>`

###Some students are able to:

- Add horizontal lines to visually break up text on the page using `<hr />`
- Understand that most HTML code uses an opening tag and a closing tag


## Lesson summary

- An introduction to some HTML tags
- A demonstration of how to create a new Google Coder webpage on a Raspberry Pi
- Student setup of Coder webservers
- Creation of a webpage using HTML tags

## Starter

Using an example of a live website such as [RaspberryPi.org](http://www.raspberrypi.org) or [bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk) in a web browser such as Google Chrome, ask students to identify different elements that make up the page: images, text, animations and so on. Next, show the source code of the page using the **view page source** option in Chrome. Explain to students that this is HTML and that it is a type of code used to make websites. Draw on previous learning to explain the tags and ask students if they can guess what some of the tags may do.

## Main development

1. Remind the class how to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers, ensuring that students are allocated the correct SD card that they used in the previous lesson. Ensure that they can all log in.

2. Next, demonstrate to the students how to create a new page on Google Coder; name it and give it a colour. See [student instructions here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-2/student-instructions-2.md).

3. Explain how to add heading text and a description of their item to review, and show them the HTML tag to do this. Give students time to try this and preview what it looks like.

4. Next, introduce students to other ways to display text (see the student instructions): breaking lines of text, adding paragraphs of text, using different heading sizes, horizontal lines and so on.

## Plenary

Select students to demonstrate their work so far to the class. Draw out through questioning what tags they used and how they worked. If students have a blog or e-portfolio they should write about what they did in the lesson, ensuring that they answer the following questions:

- What is HTML?
- What do HTML tags look like?
- What HTML tags did you use in the construction of your review page today?

## Homework

Using [Creative Commons Image Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/) students should find or make a note of images they can use on their webpage.
