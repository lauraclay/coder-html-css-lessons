# Lesson 3: Adding Images and Other Media

##Introduction

Modern webpages include more than just text; many people use image search engines, and use images in their work without respecting the licensing of the creative work they are using.

In this lesson students will be introduced to the concepts of copyright and Creative Commons, and how using other people's work without attributing them could cause legal problems. They will also learn HTML code to add images and videos to their webpages in Google Coder.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to search for appropriate images online and upload them to Google Coder on the Raspberry Pi.
- Understand who owns creative content online and how it can be shared legally.
- Be able to write HTML tags to add media to webpages and resize them.


## Learning outcomes

###All students are able to:

- Search for appropriate images online and save them
- Add an image to a webpage using HTML

###Most students are able to:

- Understand that not all images online are free to use
- Add multiple images to a webpage with HTML and be able to resize them


###Some students are able to:

- Explain the difference between copyright and Creative Commons
- Embed media from other sources using `<iframe>`



## Lesson summary

- A teacher-led discussion on copyright and Creative Commons.
- A demonstration of how to add images and videos in Google Coder, and the associated HTML tags.
- A demonstration on how to add code to resize images.
- Improving webpages with media and text.


## Starter

Using the results of the homework task, ask students to explain what images they found on [Creative Commons Search](http://search.creativecommons.org) for their item review webpage. 

Discuss the idea of who owns a image on the internet, before explaining the idea of 'Creative Commons'. Ask students to reflect on the images they found, which they will use on their webpage in today's lesson. Show students the [Sharing Creative Works](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Sharing_Creative_Works) presentation to explain how copyright could affect their work.


## Main development

1. Remind the class how to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers, ensuring that students are allocated the correct SD card that they used in the previous lesson. Ensure that they can all log in. Students can use the [student instructions](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-3/student-instructions-3.md) as a guide to remind them of the steps.

2. Demonstrate to the students how to upload an image to Google Coder from a client computer, and how to add the HTML tag to the webpage in order for it to be seen. Then explain how images can be resized, for example `<img src="/static/apps/raspberry_pi/media/raspberry_pi_pcb.png" height="400px" width="700px" />`.

3. Allow students time to try this a number of times for themselves using the [student instructions](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-3/student-instructions-3.md) for this lesson.

4. Next, demonstrate to students that images are not the only media that can be added to a webpage. Many webpages embed media from other sites like YouTube or Vimeo. If students have access to video content that can be embedded, demonstrate how they can achieve this in Google Coder. 

5. Ask students to save their work, and turn off their Raspberry Pis.

## Plenary

If students have a blog or e-portfolio they should write about what they did in the lesson, ensuring that they answer the following questions:

- Who owns an image that is uploaded to a webpage on the internet?
- Where did you get your images from and who owns them?
- How can you ensure that you are respecting the author's rights?

## Homework

Students are asked to write a short piece on copyright and Creative Commons, answering the following questions:

1. Explain how copyright protects an original creative piece like an image.
2. Explain why using people's images without their permission or knowledge is wrong.
3. What is Creative Commons?
4. Who does Creative Commons benefit and how?
5. Why is it important to check the licence of a image before you use it in your work?
